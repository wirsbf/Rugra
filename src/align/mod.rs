//! Alignment verification module for Rugra and Ghidra.
//!
//! This module contains the logic to verify that Rugra's internal data structures
//! and analysis results match Ghidra's C++ decompiler implementation.
//!
//! # Runtime Verification
//!
//! The `runtime_verify` module provides actual runtime comparison testing between
//! Rugra and Ghidra outputs, going beyond static type checking to ensure behavioral
//! equivalence. This is critical for guaranteeing output consistency.
//!
//! Note: Runtime verification requires `once_cell` dependency in Cargo.toml
