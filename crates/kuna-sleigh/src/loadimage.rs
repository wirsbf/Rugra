//! Port of `decompiler/cpp/loadimage.hh` + `loadimage.cc` (W2, item
//! `w2-sleigh-loadimage`) — classes and API for accessing a binary load
//! image.
//!
//! API mapping (vs C++):
//!
//! - The abstract class `LoadImage` becomes the [`LoadImage`] trait.  The
//!   protected `filename` member cannot live on a trait, so `getFileName()`
//!   becomes the required method [`LoadImage::get_file_name`] and each
//!   implementor stores its own filename.  The non-virtual convenience
//!   `load()` is a provided trait method.
//! - `loadFill(uint1 *ptr,int4 size,const Address &addr)` becomes
//!   `load_fill(&mut self, ptr: &mut [u8], addr: &Address)`: the
//!   (pointer,size) pair collapses into a byte slice whose length is the
//!   C++ `size` (an `int4`; requests beyond 2^31-1 bytes are unsupported,
//!   as in C++).  The unfilled-read error contract is kept exactly: where
//!   C++ throws `DataUnavailError` the Rust port returns
//!   `Err(KunaError::DataUnavail)` carrying the same explain string
//!   (`kuna_base::error` ports the exception type itself).
//! - The `const`-but-stateful symbol/section iteration methods
//!   (`openSymbols`/`getNextSymbol`/...) stay `&self`; implementors mirror
//!   the C++ `mutable` cursor members with interior mutability.
//! - `getArchType()` returns a byte string (`Vec<u8>`), following the
//!   workspace convention that marshal/XML-derived strings are byte
//!   strings (`LoadImageXml` reads its arch type straight from an XML
//!   attribute).
//! - `adjustVma(long adjust)` becomes `adjust_vma(&mut self, adjust: i64)`.
//!
//! `RawLoadImage` reads bytes directly from a file on disk.  C++ holds an
//! `ifstream *` (null until `open()`); the Rust port holds an
//! `Option<std::fs::File>`.  C++ never checks the stream state after
//! `seekg`/`read` — a failed read silently leaves the destination buffer
//! with its previous contents — so an OS-level I/O failure has no defined
//! oracle behavior; the port surfaces it as `KunaError::Lowlevel`.
