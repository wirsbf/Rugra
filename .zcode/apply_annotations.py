"""Apply Ghidra annotations from a JSON mapping to a Rust source file.

Reads a JSON array of {rust_line, rust_fn, annotation, kind} entries and
inserts the annotation line directly above each fn's definition line.

Processes from BOTTOM to TOP so line numbers in the mapping (which refer to
the ORIGINAL file) stay valid as we insert lines above.

The annotation is placed immediately above the fn line but BELOW any
`#[attribute]` lines that sit directly on top of the fn. If there is an
existing `///` doc-comment block, the annotation goes ABOVE the doc block
(so the Ghidra reference is the first thing seen).

Usage:
    python apply_annotations.py <rust_file> <json_map>
